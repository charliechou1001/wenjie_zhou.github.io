## About Me

I am a PhD candidate in **Computer Engineering** at the **University of Sydney**, working under the supervision of **Prof. Philip Leong**. My research focuses on the intersection of computer architecture and deep learning, specifically addressing the surging computational requirements of modern Deep Neural Networks (DNNs).

My dissertation investigates **low-precision block arithmetic** as a critical technique for energy-efficient training and inference. I have developed improved block arithmetic algorithms and implementation methodologies, including the **delay update** scheme, to demonstrate how hardware efficiency can be achieved without sacrificing accuracy.

Prior to my PhD, I earned my Master's degree from **Peking University**, where I focused on machine vision and automated diagnostic systems.

## Research Interests

- **Hardware Acceleration:** FPGA-based AI training acceleration.
- **Computer Arithmetic:** Low-precision block arithmetic such as Block Minifloat, Microscaling (MX) formats, and NVFP4.
- **Deep Learning:** Time-series forecasting and industrial machine vision.

## Education

- **Ph.D. in Computer Engineering**, University of Sydney, 2019 — 2025
- **M.S. in Electronics and Communication Engineering**, Peking University, 2013 — 2017
- **B.S. in Electrical Engineering**, East China University of Science and Technology, 2009 — 2013

## Skills

- Practical experience with Xilinx Alveo data center cards (Alveo U50, Alveo U250)
- Good command of High-Level Synthesis (HLS) and Verilog
- Project experience in computer vision, biological image processing, and object character recognition (OCR)

## Teaching

I have served as a Tutor for several courses at USYD:

- **ELEC1601:** Introduction to Computer Systems
- **ELEC3607:** Embedded System
- **ELEC3608:** Computer Architecture
- **ELEC5405:** Building Microchips: From Theory to Practice
- **MTRX3700:** Mechatronics 3
